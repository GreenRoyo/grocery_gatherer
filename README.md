# Welcome to Grocery-Gatherer ðŸ‘‹

The Modern Gatherer app is designed to help users collect and manage grocery items they need to purchase, similar to adding products to a shopping cart in online stores. Inspired by ancient gatherers, the app enables users to build a "collection basket" before going out, reducing the chances of forgetting or buying duplicate items.

## Background

Carrie said I can still let life go on by ordering Chinese takeout, which is true. But I prefer to take control of how life unfolds by setting specific goals. Carrie cares a lot about how we eat and what we eat. Her smile lights up when she sees the fridge full of fresh vegetables, everything well-stocked, and nothing missing from the list.

We currently live in the city centre, so our grocery shopping tends to be quite fragmented. We donâ€™t usually go to supermarkets to buy everything for the whole month, especially since we only have a small refrigerator at the moment. Thatâ€™s why I think creating this app to organize grocery shopping for each trip is a great idea. It could help make our lives smoother, more secure, and happier.
